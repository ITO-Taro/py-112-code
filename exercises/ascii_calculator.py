ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices.
There is a function for finding the ascii value of a character here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
Write a function that asks the user for input, and then computes the sum of all the ascii values of the characters.
"hello" -> 104 + 101 + 108 + 108 + 111 = 532
Part 2: Given a list of words (from user input) determine which word has the highest ascii value.
